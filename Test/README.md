Set of codes that I've implemented or I've used in the solutions.

Most of them are referenced in the [documentation](https://github.com/pin3da/Programming-contest/tree/master/doc)

A pdf version with all these codes will be posted [here](https://github.com/pin3da/Programming-contest/blob/master/codes/notebook.pdf). (caution, may be outdated).
